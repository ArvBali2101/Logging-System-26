modules:
  /drive: warn    # Drive system only shows WARN, ERROR, FATAL
  /vision: info   # Vision system shows INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
  /nav: debug     # Navigation subsystem logs everything (DEBUG and above)
  # Add new subsystems here using the same name used in the C++ logger calls.
  # Example:
  #   /water_extraction: info
  #
  # This lets each subsystem control its own log verbosity independently.
